# Spec-First Development

Don't quite need an AI IDE? Try a simpler way. Rushing into code gen without clear intent and requirements leads to wasted effort.


Try [BearClaude](https://bearclaude.specstory.com) our new macOS-specific editor in Alpha. It features:

- **Three-pane layout**: Document sidebar, editor, and Claude Code terminal for seamless workflow
- **Requirements**: macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon
- **Key workflow**: Think → Execute → Save → Repeat
- **Integration**: Works directly with Claude Code for auto-saving docs and chats locally
- **Focus**: Preserves development intent and context throughout your coding sessions

We think its just right for minimalist AI-first developers that want to focus on maintaining specs, chats and documentation alongside code. Read more about [why we are making this](https://bearclaude.specstory.com/mindfulmaking).
