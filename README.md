# SpecStory

SpecStory is a Visual Studio Code extension for the [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/). It is tested and confirmed to work for `Cursor Version: 0.43.6` and later.

We make it easy to capture, search and learn from every AI coding journey. When enabled, SpecStory automatically saves every Cursor chat and composer session to your local project's `.specstory` directory.

To learn more, check out our [website](https://specstory.com/) and read the [docs](https://docs.specstory.com/introduction).

## Getting Started

_Note: This extension only works with the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) fork of Visual Studio Code._

**Installing the extension directly from the VSC Marketplace will install it into VSC, and not into Cursor.**

**Instead, to install SpecStory into Cursor:**

- Download the VSIX file directly from our release bucket: [specstory-vscode-latest.vsix](https://static.specstory.com/vscode-extension/releases/specstory-vscode-latest.vsix)
- Next, open the Command Palette (CMD/Ctrl-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX…`
- Select the VSIX file that you downloaded above
- Verify that "SpecStory (Cursor Extension)" appears in Extensions sidebar

2️⃣ Take a quick spin through our [docs](https://docs.specstory.com/introduction), they explain installation details in more depth.

## Filing issues

> [!NOTE]
The extension is in rapid, active development.

- If you're not on `Cursor Version: 0.43.6` or later you might experience errors due to the way versions of Cursor prior to `0.43.5` stored chat and composer data that have since changed.
