    "areas": [
      {
        "name": "Go CLI Development",
        "session_count": 250,
        "description": "Extensive work on Go-based command-line applications, including refactoring commands like list to display human-readable tables with terminal-width truncation. Claude Code was heavily used for multi-file changes, code editing, and implementing new CLI features with proper package organization."
      },
      {
        "name": "AI Provenance Library Integration",
        "session_count": 120,
        "description": "Integration work on ai-provenance-lib into existing Go projects, involving Go workspace configuration with go.work files. Claude helped navigate dependency management decisions, though there was friction around replace directives vs workspace approaches for local development."
      },
      {
        "name": "Code Refactoring and Review",
        "session_count": 150,
        "description": "Substantial code review and refactoring efforts across the codebase, with Claude performing comprehensive reviews and implementing targeted fixes. Sessions often involved identifying issues and systematically addressing them, leveraging Read and Edit tools extensively."
      },
      {
        "name": "Build and Configuration Management",
        "session_count": 80,
        "description": "Work on build configurations, YAML files, and project setup across Go and other languages. Claude assisted with dependency management, workspace configuration, and ensuring proper build tooling across multiple projects."
      },
      {
        "name": "Planning and Workflow Documentation",
        "session_count": 60,
        "description": "Daily planning workflows and documentation efforts using Markdown, where Claude gathered information from brain dumps to draft planning documents. This included task organization and TodoWrite usage for tracking work items."
      }
    ]
  },
  "interaction_style": {
    "narrative": "You engage with Claude Code as a **highly active power user**, averaging over 6 messages per session across 661 sessions—a substantial two-month engagement period. Your workflow centers on **Go development** (6,885 lines touched), with a balanced split between feature implementation and code refactoring (55 sessions each). You demonstrate a pattern of **iterative collaboration with active course correction**: when Claude proposed a go.mod replace directive, you rejected it and pushed for the correct go.work approach. Similarly, you caught Claude contradicting itself on recommendations and corrected a miscount of days—showing you **closely monitor Claude's reasoning rather than accepting outputs blindly**.\n\nYour tool usage reveals a **read-heavy, edit-intensive workflow** with Read (6,593) and Edit (6,154) dominating, suggesting you prefer Claude to thoroughly understand context before making changes. The high AskUserQuestion count (963) indicates you've configured Claude to check in frequently, and the TodoWrite usage (637) shows you leverage planning features. Your sessions often end at natural breakpoints—'partially_achieved' outcomes correlate with sessions cut short mid-task rather than failures. The **67 'wrong_approach' friction events** combined with your pattern of rejecting incorrect suggestions shows you're comfortable redirecting Claude firmly when it veers off course, treating it as a collaborative tool rather than an oracle.",
    "key_pattern": "You maintain tight oversight during complex tasks, quickly interrupting and correcting Claude's approach when it diverges from your technical preferences or makes logical errors."
  },
  "what_works": {
    "intro": "You're a power user running Go-focused development sessions with heavy file operations and a balanced mix of feature work and refactoring.",
    "impressive_workflows": [
      {
        "title": "Structured Daily Planning Sessions",
        "description": "You've established a brain dump to planning document workflow that helps you organize your thoughts and priorities. This systematic approach to starting your day with Claude shows thoughtful integration of AI into your personal productivity routine."
      },
      {
        "title": "Multi-File Refactoring at Scale",
        "description": "Your sessions show strong success with complex multi-file changes, particularly when restructuring Go code like moving commands to new packages with proper table formatting. You're leveraging Claude's ability to handle interconnected edits across your codebase effectively."
      },
      {
        "title": "Critical Review and Course Correction",
        "description": "You actively push back when Claude makes mistakes—whether it's rejecting inappropriate replace directives, correcting miscounts, or calling out contradictory recommendations. This collaborative friction leads to better outcomes and shows you're using Claude as a tool you direct rather than blindly follow."

        "description": "You're working extensively with Go and Claude sometimes proposes module configurations that don't match your development workflow needs. Being explicit upfront about your local vs production requirements could prevent these detours.",
        "examples": [
          "Claude suggested a replace directive for ai-provenance-lib that would be always active, when you needed something only for local development—requiring you to reject and explain the difference",
          "After correctly setting up go.work, Claude still proposed the replace directive approach, showing it didn't fully understand your modular development strategy"
        ]
      },
      {
        "category": "Inconsistent or Self-Contradicting Recommendations",
        "description": "Claude occasionally provides recommendations that contradict themselves within the same response, forcing you to call out the confusion and seek clarification. Asking Claude to re-read its own suggestions before finalizing could help.",
        "examples": [
          "Claude labeled Option A as 'Recommended' but then stated it recommends Option B, which you had to explicitly point out",
          "Claude miscounted the number of days you had slipped on your routine, requiring you to correct basic factual information it should have tracked accurately"
        ]
      },
      {
        "category": "Sessions Ending Before Full Completion",
        "description": "Your sessions frequently reach only partial achievement, with work cut short before Claude finishes implementing fixes or completing workflows. Breaking complex tasks into smaller, completable chunks might improve your outcome rates.",
        "examples": [
          "Your daily planning workflow session was cut short before full completion, leaving the planning document in draft state",
          "A code review session identified issues #12 and #17 to fix, but Claude only began the fix before the session ended without completing it"

## At a Glance

**What's working:** You've built a solid rhythm around Go CLI development and multi-file refactoring, with Claude handling interconnected edits across your codebase effectively. Your willingness to push back when Claude gets things wrong—like rejecting inappropriate replace directives or calling out contradictory recommendations—leads to better outcomes and shows you're directing the tool rather than following it blindly. See _Impressive Things You Did_.

**What's hindering you:** On Claude's side, there's a pattern of proposing solutions that don't match your actual workflow needs, particularly around Go module configuration, and occasionally contradicting itself within the same response. On your side, sessions often end before work is fully complete, and Claude frequently asks clarifying questions—suggesting that more upfront context about your preferences and constraints could smooth things out. See _Where Things Go Wrong_.

**Quick wins to try:** Try creating a Custom Skill for your daily planning workflow—you've already established the brain dump to planning doc pattern, so a single /plan command could streamline the kickoff. You might also experiment with Task Agents for your code reviews, letting Claude spawn focused sub-agents to explore different issues in parallel rather than tackling them sequentially. See _Features to Try_.

**Ambitious workflows:** As models improve, expect Claude to handle full test-driven refactoring autonomously—running your Go tests after each change and iterating until everything passes, rather than stopping partway through. Your integration friction with go.work vs replace directives should also disappear when Claude can validate module configurations and test imports before proposing changes, catching mistakes upfront. See _On the Horizon_.
